# Contributing

We're friendly, we don't bite.  To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Check it in and push it to your fork
4. Open a pull request

You only need one approval, so once a maintainer has taken a look, they'll merge your pull request.  Feel free to request a review if there's someone specific you want to review your PR.
